# kepi

kepi is a Django-based microblogging system, implemented in Python.
It uses the ActivityPub protocol to communicate with other servers,
and the Mastodon protocol to communicate with clients.

There is nothing particularly interesting at [kepi.org.uk](https://kepi.org.uk),
but there will be.
